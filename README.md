# SPACEX GRAPHQL APP  

### You can access the live version of this project [here](https://spacex-graphql-app.herokuapp.com/).  

This app is a read only app that uses [SpaceX-API v3](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2025350/RWaEzAiG) to display all the rocket launches ever conducted by SpaceX.  

With this app, you can view basic launch details and rocket details for each launch.  

The app uses a *GraphQL Server* in the backend which fetches data from SpaceX API.  

The app uses *React* in the frontend for the UI.

The app uses *React Apollo* in the frontend to communicate with the *GraphQL Server*.

Finally, the app both frontend and backend are deployed on *Heroku*.
